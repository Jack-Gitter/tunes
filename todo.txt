endpoints: 
    general
        c.shouldbindURI? -- can/should make a middleware to validate path params using c.shouldbindURI -- yes, I'm being lazy asf
            make a generic middleware which takes in an object, and then does c.shouldbinduri on it also takes in a function to call stuff on... prety much same as existing
        users
            make a getFeed endpoint which gets all of the posts from the users followers and returns the top x most recent, make it paginated

caching questions: 
    i validate cadhe on every data change — what about data race with get and data change where data change clears cache but get reaches db first and caches data?
    also updating cache after db writes — we have one post then another which changes a value. A hits db first then b, but b writes to cache first then a. how to prevent?
