        make sure to set transaction isolation level to repeatable read everywhere we do a transaction!!!
        do transaction retires where applicable!!! when we're inserting, not just for reading because we don't need it then
        clean up some data models? I'm returning some fields that are nil when I'm doing the getProperties methods, can clean that up into postPropertyDTO, userPropertyDTO, and commentPropertyDTO
    posts
        get user feed endpoint!!!

sql: 
    if i do a join where i only have 1 post but many comments that relate to that post, what data gets returned


testing:
    implement tests -- e2e test with testing library!
    implement a git workflow to run tests on push

admin: 
    cors

caching questions: 
    i validate cadhe on every data change — what about data race with get and data change where data change clears cache but get reaches db first and caches data?
    also updating cache after db writes — we have one post then another which changes a value. A hits db first then b, but b writes to cache first then a. how to prevent?
