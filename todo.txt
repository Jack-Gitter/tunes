data integrity:
    make GetUserFromDbBySpotifyID a cypher transaction so that if we fetch a user and delete a user at the same time, the user is not returned with no posts
    protobuf?

caching questions: 
    i validate cadhe on every data change — what about data race with get and data change where data change clears cache but get reaches db first and caches data?
    also updating cache after db writes — we have one post then another which changes a value. A hits db first then b, but b writes to cache first then a. how to prevent?
