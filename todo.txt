If you are seeing this, then it means that the project is probably done :) We'll see if I ever actually build the frontend


potentially should I use nginx as a reverse proxy just to become familiar with it? seems so easy and dumb for only one instance

todo: 
    set up nginx as a reverse proxy
        have docker spin up multiple instances of the tunesService
        put an nginx container infront of it using docker -- It really doesn't make sense to have it on the same machine, but for learning sake yes
        update the readme and resume
    profile pictures
        set up an s3 bucket to store profile pictures
        set up an endpoint that is multipartform or octet-stream which resizes the images and then pushes them to s3
        store the s3 url in the database and return to user on userGet for currentUser and getting other user
        set up CDN to make loading profile pictures quicker
        IAM policies???
