If you are seeing this, then it means that the project is probably done :) We'll see if I ever actually build the frontend


potentially should I use nginx as a reverse proxy just to become familiar with it? seems so easy and dumb for only one instance

todo: 
    set up nginx as a reverse proxy
        have docker spin up multiple instances of the tunesService
        put an nginx container infront of it using docker -- It really doesn't make sense to have it on the same machine, but for learning sake yes
        update the readme and resume
