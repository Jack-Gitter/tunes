    rework errors on the DB level. check to see what type of neo4j error is thrown, wrap 

endpoints: 
    general: 
        clean up endpoint names
        constraints -- need to make them on users and posts
    user

        like another post

caching:
    redis 
        read up on caching techniques!!! 

dockerize:
    neo4j
    redis

admin: 
    cors

caching questions: 
    i validate cadhe on every data change — what about data race with get and data change where data change clears cache but get reaches db first and caches data?
    also updating cache after db writes — we have one post then another which changes a value. A hits db first then b, but b writes to cache first then a. how to prevent?

testing:
    implement tests
    implement a git workflow to run tests on push

general: 
    swagger?
    rework file structure?
