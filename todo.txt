If you are seeing this, then it means that the project is probably done :) We'll see if I ever actually build the frontend


make the admin user a management user in rabitmq -- idk how to do that
start on the consumer application. Its very simple, just needs to 
    initialize a connection to the db 
    do a query to get all user followersb
    listen for incomming messages. If it is a post message, then do the above
    send out an email to all followers who have an email in their account

todo: 
    make constructors for everything! main is messy lol
