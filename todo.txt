caching:
    redis 
        read up on caching techniques!!!  -- or do in memory lol, i'm a lazy bitch

testing
    mocks and spies for DAO responses -- could easily do this if i wanted to, but would take a fuckton of time -- probably just do caching first :) 

testing:
    implement tests -- e2e test with testing library!
    implement a git workflow to run tests on push

admin: 
    cors
