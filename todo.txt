data integrity:
    protobuf?
    
testing:
    implement tests
    implement a git workflow to run tests on push

endpoints: 
    general: 
        make helper methods for post handlers to reduce code between spotifyID and currentUser endpoints
    user
        update
        delete
    posts
        postPreviewByID --> make it keyset pagination instead. It is much better!
        update
    comments
        create
        read (paginated)

caching questions: 
    i validate cadhe on every data change — what about data race with get and data change where data change clears cache but get reaches db first and caches data?
    also updating cache after db writes — we have one post then another which changes a value. A hits db first then b, but b writes to cache first then a. how to prevent?
