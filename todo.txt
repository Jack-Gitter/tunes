        read up on caching techniques!!! 


sql: 
    if i do a join where i only have 1 post but many comments that relate to that post, what data gets returned


testing:
    implement tests -- e2e test with testing library!
    implement a git workflow to run tests on push

admin: 
    cors

caching questions: 
    i validate cadhe on every data change — what about data race with get and data change where data change clears cache but get reaches db first and caches data?
    also updating cache after db writes — we have one post then another which changes a value. A hits db first then b, but b writes to cache first then a. how to prevent?
